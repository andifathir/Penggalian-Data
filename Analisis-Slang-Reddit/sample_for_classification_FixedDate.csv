"Title: Atletico Madrid 2 - [3] Barcelona - Lamine Yamal 90+2'
Text: 
Comment: Yea, then they come and eliminate us in a quarter final 🤣 football is just crazy man.

But this season I feel like Barca got the upper hands in both league and copa, even though it ended in 4-4. Also, Atletico actually playing good football. Our first fixture was more of how I remember Atletico to play.",5384,6,2025-03-17,soccer,2025-03-16

Comment: Even if the police don’t believe you, they’ll still often act like they do to let you dig your own grave.

It’s one thing for you to lie in one interview, get called out, then shut down and stop talking. It’s another for you to lie to police the whole time while the evidence piles up against you.

Plus, in the off chance you aren’t lying, the police still win.",672,36,2025-03-10,OutOfTheLoop,2025-03-10

Text: For me personally, the games look and perform great as it is. The only thing that'll tempt me to get another 500 dollar box are the next gen only games that'll inevitably get announced. 
Comment: I’m mixed on it while there’s clearly some negatives. It also allows people who don’t have that much money to game.

"Title: What's the deal with Schumer and AOC fighting over the gov shutdown vote?
Text: AOC is saying that any Democrat voting for the spending bill is wrong because it gives Trump what he wants.

https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3lkbzb5qzdk2u

Schumer is saying that not voting for the shutdown is foolish because it gives Trump total control.

https://bsky.app/profile/schumer.senate.gov/post/3lkcngve4rk2b

  

Which is it?

I'm generally pro AOC but I don't really get what's going on here.
Comment: AOC is still fighting for the people even after the Dems tries to silence her.

Chuck Schumer was called a Palestinian by Trump which scared him so much he caved and does whatever Trump wants now just like Fetterman.

Democrats are disgusting.  It's no wonder they always lose.",4081,16,2025-03-14,OutOfTheLoop,2025-03-14

"Title: This ‘Street Fighter’ comic predates the first game by a year and is totally unrelated
Text: 
Comment: I agree this one might be one of the most similar to the street fighter logo I’ve seen, this style was really popular with action at the time. There are a bunch of street fighting movies with this graffiti style. So while you could easily say “the street fighter logo is a rip off of this + the Indians jones logo” it’s possible they got their naturally since it does follow a lot of trendy design elements at the time (first and last letter enlarges, long tails, angled upward, etc.)",143,3,2025-03-16,gaming,2025-03-16
"Title: What is up with Trump saying he stopped a smaller nation from going to war?
Text: In his meeting with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, Trump briefly said

> I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking about going to war on something that nobody in this room has ever even heard about. Two smaller nations—but big, still big—and I think I've stopped it, but this should have never happened. ([source](https://youtu.be/S_YtXWVfkJE?t=1830))

What nation is he referring to, and why would they be thinking about going to war?

Edit: People, please stop spewing the propaganda. Remember, it's still propaganda even if it's true. I'm not looking for answers that assume Trump is lying, because that hardly effects my life. But, a new war is a *big deal*, so I'm asking out of an abundance of caution, and looking for answers where he could be telling the truth. The repeated, ""he's just lying,"" is really pissing me off, because I know Trump lies but those kind of answers don't help me here, at all.

Edit 2: Look, only ONE person needs to tell me that they think Trump is lying/exaggerating here. Everyone else please just go and upvote that ONE person, that way anyone that has anything interesting to say isn't drowned out. So far, these are the most popular theories I've been seeing:

1. Trump is lying.
2. Armenia (against Azerbaijan)
3. Kosovo (against Serbia)

"Title: What was the first game that made you realize videogames were capable of telling a captivating story and immerse you in its world?
Text: The older I got the more I've come to enjoy the game more when I'm invested into the world and its characters. The why were doing what were doing and finding out more about the world we are exploring. Sure gameplay can ""at times"" carry a game with a lackluster story but nothing beats a great story with gameplay to match.

For me, the first game that made me realize that was Bioshock. From Andrew Ryan's ideology, the city of rapture and its inhabitants, the downfall of this underwater utopia and overall themes of the world we find ourselves in. I was truly invested and wished to find every audio log or look around the environments to understand/learn about the rapture more. Voice acting, environmental storytelling and writing is almost unmatched to me.
